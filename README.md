# Hope Engine (Project Storyteller) - Narrative RPG System
Hope Engine is a text-first, stat-driven narrative RPG framework built for online, asynchronous, or real-time storytelling experiences. Designed to balance tactical choices with emotional storytelling, it offers a flexible system grounded in body, mind, and soul.

## Project Goals
- Create a **modular RPG system** that works across digital and (eventually) tabletop formats.
- Prioritize **asynchronous play**, where players can interact in text over time.
- Blend **stat-crunching depth** with **emotionally grounded storytelling**.
- Enable **character-driven design**, where personality influences playstyle.

## Core System Highlights
- **Three Attributes**: Body, Mind, Soul.
- **Three Approaches**: Force (direct), Focus (enduring), Finesse (indirect).
- **Momentum-Based Initiative**: Speed builds over time, allowing faster characters more frequent actions.
- **Hope System**: A layered vitality mechanic that only depletes once energy pools are exhausted—turning battle into a war of attrition and willpower.

## Status
> **In Development** – The system is functional at a prototype level. Core mechanics are defined, and early testing is underway via spreadsheet and Figma visualization. A public-facing HTML/CSS version is planned for initial user feedback and presentation.

## Contributing
While the system is in active solo development, feedback, ideas, or playtesting notes are welcomed. Reach out or fork the project to suggest improvements.

## 🗂️ License
Final license TBD upon publishing the first system reference document (SRD).
